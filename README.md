WEBSITE OVERVIEW
-------------------

This is a redesigned website for a church in Cork, Ireland. Their original site suffered from content overload. The multiple navigations made it difficult for the user to smoothly and intuitively move through the site. I added a fixed header to keep the helpful links nearby. I also made their site responsive and added some jQuery functionality to link a daily devotional to the landing page.
