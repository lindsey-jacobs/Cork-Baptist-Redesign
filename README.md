WEBSITE OVERVIEW
-------------------

This is a redesigned website for a church in Cork, Ireland. Their original site suffered from content overload [http://www.corkbaptist.org].

Multiple navigations made it difficult for the user to smoothly and intuitively move through the site. I added a fixed header to keep the helpful links nearby, as well as a footer with the extra external or secondary links.

One thing I am still thinking through is the image menu in the middle of the page &mdash; the three circles of maps that, when hovered, link to other pages on the site. On a mobile device, since there is no hover, it would not be intuitive to click one of these circles without knowing where it leads.

Along with making the site a little bit more visually appealing, I made their site responsive and arranged the important content in a way that is easier to read. Their website now showcases their vision and their brand simply through decisions such as placing their tagline on the header image, having consistent spacing, and utilizing full-width images of drawings of the city of Cork.

I only have the index.html page completed for now, but my goal is complete the site and ask if they would like to use it as their updated webpage.
